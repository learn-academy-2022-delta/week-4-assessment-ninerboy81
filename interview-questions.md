# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props in React is the data that is passed into a component. It comes from the parent component.

  Researched answer: Props is a special keyword in React that is being used for passing data through components to one another. Props can only flow one way, from parent to child. Because it is a one way flow, it is not possible to pass data from child to parent.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is when in the browser a users javascript code is being executed. Usually this is when a user clicks on a button, or when a user enters a value in a form. 

  Researched answer: DOM events are also known as user events, meaning that there are functions that are being executed when a user interacts with the browser. Examples: click, keypress, mouseover, mouseout, etc.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: From what i can remember is that object oriented programming mean that most if not all your code that you write will be created with objects. This means that you can create objects that have properites and methods. This is different than functional programming, which is when you create functions that are not objects. 

  Researched answer: Functional programming is a top down stragety meaning that you create functions that are not objects in a hierarchy. Object oriented programming is a bottom up strategy meaning that you create objects that have properties and methods. You also focus more attention on the data that you are creating rather than the functions that you are creating.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is a number that returns a decimal value. An integer is a number that returns only the whole number.

  Researched answer: A integer is a number without a decimal point. Using a float would be for situations where a more precise number is needed.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: I do not recall what an implicit return means. I believe its a way to return a value without having to call for it. 

  Researched answer: Implicit return is a way to return a value without having to call for it. This is useful for functions that are being called in a loop. Some people tend to not use the return keyboard explicity, but instead use the implicit return.
